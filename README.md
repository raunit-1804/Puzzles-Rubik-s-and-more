# PUZZLES SOLVER!
<h4>1. Rubik's Cube Solver </h4>   
<ul>
  <li> A simple but dumb (not as naive as a simple BFS :p ) C++ program which solves the Rubik's cube. The algorithm is not the most efficient but it works just fine as long as the input provided by the user is in the correct manner and order otherwise the code just slides into an infinite loop :) </li>
  <li>The manner in which the input is to be provided has been included in the comments properly!</li> 
  <li>The overview of the algorithm is that it follows the simple layer by layer method</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Sudoku Solver </h4>   
<ul>
  <li>Input an unsolved (solvable or unsolvable) Sudoku board and it will output the correct solution(if it exists).</li>
  <li>The algorithm used is recursion along with backtracking.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Lights Out Game with a solver! </h4>   
<ul>
  <li>Check out the game at : https://nipung314.github.io/lightsOut/</li>
  <li>The algorithm for the solver is a BFS with a time complexity : O(2 ^ (n * n)) along with the parent map.</li>
</ul>
